# Physical in-module XX and Y surgery

Read `AGENTS.md` and `STATUS.md` first. Complete only this phase, update the status log, and stop.

Use the Anaconda environment `tour_de_gross` for every Python install, build and test (`conda activate tour_de_gross`, or `conda run --no-capture-output -n tour_de_gross ...`). Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for setup. Keep external source checkouts under `/home/quantum_teresheys/workspace/tour_de_gross_design_bundle/external_libs` (repository-relative `external_libs/` on other machines); install their Python dependencies into this environment. Before modifying any external library, fork it under the user's GitHub account and work from that fork; retain upstream attribution, licenses, exact commits and source hashes. Put main simulation code under `src/gross_design_bandle/`, with benchmark code in its separate `bench/` namespace. These paths supersede the earlier proposed `bb_surgery` / `bb_surgery_bench` layout; they do not introduce implemented simulation APIs.

## Branch and publication workflow

Implement this phase on a dedicated `feature/<phase-stem>` branch in a separate Git worktree created from validated `main`. Switch the working directory to that worktree before editing and testing; keep the main checkout clean. Under the tmux pipeline, the controller provides the branch/worktree and owns Git publication: finish the phase and its validation, then stop so it can rerun acceptance tests, commit the feature, merge it to `main`, and atomically push the feature branch and `main` to `origin`. Outside the pipeline, perform that same sequence yourself after validation passes. Do not merge or publish failed/incomplete work, force-push, discard existing edits, or push external upstream repositories. Preserve the feature worktree on failure for review. Record the branch, worktree, validation commands and publication outcome in the handoff.

## Task

Use the validated engine to activate the full LPU for X1 X7 and Y1. The Y target must be implemented as one signed Hermitian Pauli with mixed checks, including correct port combinations at shared support. Carry physical Bell partition, dressing, detector flows and split frames through the full operation. Use C=10 in the gross reference profile.

## Tests and scope limit

Implement B04 and full D-level tests for these operations, including product-only versus separate-factor measurement. Confirm the same installed LPU geometry is used while active Pauli labels/connections differ. Compare fault ledgers with Table-6 gross XX and Y targets without padding N.

## Acceptance

Gross X1 X7 and Y1 complete physical circuits pass instrument/flow/schedule tests; any remaining Table-6 mismatch is recorded and prevents an exact-reproduction claim.

## Handoff

Summarize files changed, commands actually run, evidence paths, failures and unresolved scientific assumptions. Update `STATUS.md` with the next prompt and a short reproducible command sequence. Do not mark skipped or planned tests as passed. Do not run a later phase automatically.
